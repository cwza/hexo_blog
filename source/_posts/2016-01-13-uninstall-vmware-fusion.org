* Manually uninstalling VMware Fusion 8.x, 7.x, 6.x, 5.x and 4.x

In VMware Fusion 4.x, 5.x, 6.x, 7.x and 8.x, there is no uninstaller. Most VMware Fusion files are contained within the application bundle (that is, the VMware Fusion application in /*Applications*). To uninstall VMware Fusion 4.x, 5.x, 6.x,7.x or 8.x, drag the application bundle from the Applications folder to the Trash.

Also ensure that you delete these additional files and folders, if they are present:

*Note*: Depending on the environment, some of these files may not be present. Some files may exist only if VMware Fusion 3 was originally installed on a machine that was later upgraded to VMware Fusion 4.x, 5.x, 6.x, 7.x or 8.x.
